== What does this application do?

This is a simple scala (sbt) based application to use spark context and we will study the effect of different regularizations with respect to different hyper-parameters by building a linear regression model for the data file

Note: The program is supplied with a sample_linear_regression_data.txt file to perform the operation. However, the file is not uploaded in the repo due to memory constraints.
